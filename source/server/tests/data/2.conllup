Either	_
the	_
well	_
was	_
very	_
deep,	_
or	_
she	_
fell	_
very	_
slowly,	_
for	_
she	_
had	_
plenty	_
of	_
time	_
as	_
she	_
went	_
down	_
to	_
look	_
about	_
her	_
and	_
to	_
wonder	_
what	_
was	_
going	_
to	_
happen	Label two
next.	_
First,	_
she	_
tried	_
to	_
look	_
down	_
and	_
make	_
out	_
what	_
she	_
was	_
coming	_
to,	_
but	_
it	_
was	_
too	_
dark	_
to	_
see	_
anything;	_
then	_
she	_
looked	_
at	_
the	_
sides	_
of	_
the	_
well,	_
and	_
noticed	_
that	_
they	_
were	_
filled	_
with	_
cupboards	_
and	_
book-shelves;	_
here	_
and	_
there	_
she	_
saw	_
maps	_
and	_
pictures	_
hung	_
upon	_
pegs.	_
She	_
took	_
down	_
a	_
jar	_
from	_
one	_
of	_
the	_
shelves	_
as	_
she	_
passed;	_
it	_
was	_
labelled	_
`ORANGE	_
MARMALADE',	_
but	_
to	_
her	_
great	_
disappointment	_
it	_
was	_
empty:	_
she	_
did	_
not	_
like	_
to	_
drop	_
the	_
jar	_
for	_
fear	_
of	_
killing	_
somebody,	_
so	_
managed	_
to	_
put	_
it	_
into	_
one	_
of	_
the	_
cupboards	_
as	_
she	_
fell	_
past	_
it.	_

	_

`Well!'	_
thought	_
Alice	_
to	_
herself,	_
`after	_
such	_
a	_
fall	_
as	_
this,	_
I	_
shall	_
think	_
nothing	_
of	_
tumbling	_
down	_
stairs!	_
How	_
brave	_
they'll	_
all	_
think	_
me	_
at	_
home!	_
Why,	_
I	_
wouldn't	_
say	_
anything	_
about	_
it,	_
even	_
if	_
I	_
fell	_
off	_
the	_
top	_
of	_
the	_
house!'	_
(Which	_
was	_
very	_
likely	_
true.)	_

	_

Down,	_
down,	_
down.	_
Would	_
the	_
fall	_
never	_
come	_
to	_
an	_
end!	_
`I	_
wonder	_
how	_
many	_
miles	_
I've	_
fallen	_
by	_
this	_
time?'	_
she	_
said	_
aloud.	_
`I	_
must	_
be	_
getting	_
somewhere	_
near	_
the	_
centre	_
of	_
the	_
earth.	_
Let	_
me	_
see:	_
that	_
would	_
be	_
four	_
thousand	_
miles	_
down,	_
I	_
think--'	_
(for,	_
you	_
see,	_
Alice	_
had	_
learnt	_
several	_
things	_
of	_
this	_
sort	_
in	_
her	_
lessons	_
in	_
the	_
schoolroom,	_
and	_
though	_
this	_
was	_
not	_
a	_
very	_
good	_
opportunity	_
for	_
showing	_
off	_
her	_
knowledge,	_
as	_
there	_
was	_
no	_
one	_
to	_
listen	_
to	_
her,	_
still	_
it	_
was	_
good	_
practice	_
to	_
say	_
it	_
over)	_
`--yes,	_
that's	_
about	_
the	_
right	_
distance--but	_
then	_
I	_
wonder	_
what	_
Latitude	_
or	_
Longitude	_
I've	_
got	_
to?'	_
(Alice	_
had	_
no	_
idea	_
what	_
Latitude	_
was,	_
or	_
Longitude	_
either,	_
but	_
thought	_
they	_
were	_
nice	_
grand	_
words	_
to	_
say.)	_
